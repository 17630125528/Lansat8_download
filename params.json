It was primarily included in [CESBIO Multitemp blog](http://www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr/multitemp/), then moved here for a better convenience.\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\nThere is a short user manual here :\r\n+ https://github.com/olivierhagolle/LANDSAT-Download/wiki\r\n\r\n## Get the code\r\nYou may directly read the code here :\r\n+ https://github.com/olivierhagolle/LANDSAT-Download\r\n\r\n## Other Landsat products\r\nFinally, the THEIA Land Data Center also distributes all the LANDSAT8 data acquired above France, with an accurate cloud mask and a good atmospheric correction. You can access them here :\r\n+ http://www.theia-land.fr/en/products/landsat-5-7-and-8\r\n\r\n## Sentinel-Download\r\nI have also written a much simpler tool to get ESA Sentinel data.\r\n+ http://olivierhagolle.github.io/Sentinel-download/\r\n","google":"UA-37485563-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
